# GenericDataAccess_EFCore

  *This is a practice project for me to practice and learn the best ways to implement Data Access Repositories using **SOLID** design patterns, **EF6 / EFCore**, and Interfaces*
  ---
  The goal is to fully implement a library that will: 
  - Allow the implentations to access data consistently.
  - Maintain a DRY coding method.
  - In turn will reduce errors, increase readablility, and allow for scalability.

## TODO
- [x] Create GitHub Repo
- [ ] Add XML Documentation Tags.[^1]
- [x] Convert to EFCore to work with .Net Core 3.1
- [ ] Finish Interface
